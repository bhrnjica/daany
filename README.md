Daany - Data Analytic C# library with the implementation of Matrix, DataFrame, generator, and decomposition of Time series and various statistics' parameters.

Daany DataFrame seems to be similar to Pandas, but the implementation follows the .NET coding paradigm rather than pandas look and feel. The data frame implementation contains basic capabilities:

- creation from a list and a dictionary,
- filtering capabilities,
- joining two or more data frame by common column,
- handling rows and columns of the data frame
- handling missing values, by dropping and replacing values on a specific column,
- grouping data in the data frame,
- aggregation on grouped data in the data frame,
- calculated column,
- apply an operation on a specific column/row in the data frame,
- ...
